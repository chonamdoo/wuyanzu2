Get a birthday calendar for all your social networks right inside Google
Calendar. Supports *Facebook*, *LinkedIn*, *Xing*, *Skype*, *DavDroid* and all
other apps which sync contacts with your Android device. Enable reminder
alarms and decide which contacts you want to see. You'll get notifications
for all of them.

## Features
- Birthdays and anniversaries for all your contacts
- Customizable reminders (same day, one day in advance, ...) and the calendar
   color
- Hide the app icon after setting it up so that it does not get in your way
- Tablet support

## Source code
The source demonstrates how to use Android's account and sync frameworks as well
how to create services, intent services and the communication between the
components. It also showcases the usage of the contacts and calendar providers.
